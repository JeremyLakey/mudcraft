# What is this?

I'm calling this project MUDcraft.

MUDs or Multi User Dungeons are text based real-time multiplayer games. Instead, I built a version of one that uses Minecraft as the engine and you play through a bot on the terminal. 

Basically this is a text base interface for playing minecraft.

When this is in an more mvp state, I'll release a guide for playing.
